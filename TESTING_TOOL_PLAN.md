# Comprehensive Performance Testing Tool Plan

## Overall Goal

Create a robust, automated performance testing framework that enables reliable comparison of web application performance across infrastructure changes, deployments, and environments. The tool should provide actionable insights into connection timing, resource loading, and user experience metrics while being sensitive enough to detect meaningful performance regressions and improvements.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Infrastructure Change Detection**: Accurately measure performance impact of CDN changes, server optimizations, code deployments, and architectural modifications
2. **Cross-Environment Comparison**: Reliably compare performance between development, staging, and production environments
3. **Regression Prevention**: Automatically detect performance degradations before they reach production
4. **Baseline Establishment**: Create historical performance baselines for trend analysis and capacity planning
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Provide detailed metrics to identify specific bottlenecks (network, server, client-side)
